   #About me 
    I studied telecommunication in TUM back then in 2012. I interned in meteorological department in Nairobi. Worked for Zuku as a technician doing various jobs    
    from installing to design . Then decided to add on my skills in the technical world of sound equipments in Yamaha Corporation under Credible Sounds in Nairobi. 
    This broadened my mind and still desire to learn and keep on adding to my knowledge and sharpening my skills. This is the reason I'm here in Moringa School. 
  # my hobbies are:
   - I enjoy drawing and design.
   - Watching movies also interests me 
   - when outside I ride a bike and also swim.
